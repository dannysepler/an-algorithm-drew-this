An Algorithm Drew This
======================

## Why

This repo generates random algorithmic images, to prove that just because
an "algorithm" was used to make an image doesn't necessarily mean that
the image is impressive.

There are lots of cool algorithmic images, but give a discerning eye to them!
Ask what the algorithm is doing. Et cetera.

## How to run

1. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

2. Run script:
